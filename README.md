### My Featured Projects

https://github.com/JMPenyaP/fixerstore: Participated in the development of an E-commerce web platform as a Backend Developer within an 8-member team. This platform boasts a comprehensive set of features for visitors, including browsing the homepage (product catalog and offers), viewing product details, reading product reviews, creating wishlists, communicating with the store by WhatsApp, and registering as a customer.
https://github.com/andresisfx/Pokemon-project.git : Developed a web application featuring a variety of PokÃ©mon trading cards. The primary challenge revolved around handling a substantial API with intricate logic, which I tackled by studying code from similar API-driven projects. I undertook this project to apply and enhance skills acquired in recent months, crafting both backend and frontend code to fetch external data, in this case, PokÃ©mon trading card information, and display it on the client side.
https://github.com/andresisfx/Food-project.git: Developed this project with the aim of practicing the skills I've acquired over the past few months. Within the project, I wrote code for both the backend and the frontend, crafting the necessary logic to fetch data from an external API and render it on the client side. The main challenge of this project was implementing the logic to capture only the required information and make it available to the frontend for rendering. I was able to overcome this challenge by diligently reading documentation and dedicating a significant amount of time to code challenges
